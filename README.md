# Sudoku Puzzle Game
This is a simple implementation of a Sudoku game using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI. It allows players to solve Sudoku puzzles, verifies the correctness of the solution, and can generate new puzzles for endless fun.

## Features

- Generate new Sudoku puzzles with a single click.
- Clear the puzzle board to start over.
- Verify the current state of the puzzle against Sudoku rules using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) simulation.
- Provides a user-friendly graphical interface to interact with the Sudoku board.

## Installation

To run this game, you will need Python installed on your machine. After cloning or downloading the repository, navigate to the directory containing the `sudoku.py` file in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
python sudoku.py
```

## Usage

Upon launching the game, a randomly generated Sudoku puzzle will appear. You can start solving the puzzle by entering numbers into the cells. Use the following buttons for additional actions:

- **Generate New Puzzle**: Clears the current puzzle and generates a new one.
- **Clear**: Clears all entries you've made in the current puzzle.
- **Verify (ZKP)**: Verifies the correctness of your entries against Sudoku rules using a Zero-Knowledge Proof simulation.

## Troubleshooting

Ensure you have Python and Tkinter installed on your machine. Tkinter is included with Python from Python 3.1 onwards. If you encounter any issues, verify your Python installation and ensure Tkinter is accessible.
